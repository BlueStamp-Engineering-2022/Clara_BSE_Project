# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project

Today I started by working on my starter project: a useless machine. We first learned soldering and then I started doing soldering on my starter project. There is a switch on the outside of the useless machine, but when you press it, the motor inside rotates the arm to reach out of the box and push the switch back to its original position, and rotate backwards into the box. Inside the box is another button. It is pressed in before we turn the switch outside, but once we do and the arm moves, the button is released. When the button is released and the switch outside is at the original position, the current flows to the opposite direction, and the motor moves the arm to rotate backward. 
The challenge was that I first put the switch on the wrong side, and then I stuffed all the holes for the LED light, then I had to push the LED light in while heating the holes. The main issue was that for some reason, in order to have the little handle to roll up and push the switch, the switch cannot go all the way. We didn’t figure out why but we ended up solving this problem by putting together some metal wire and duct tapes to stop the switch from going all the way. The hardest part was the final assembly. It was hard to screw the little box together.
